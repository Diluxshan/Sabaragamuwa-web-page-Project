My Life, My Favorites<br>

<br><br>I have a few different interests that entertain me while I live this crazy life of mine. I’d like to think I spend most of my time wisely, but I’ve been known to get carried away with stress-free activities such as shopping, socializing and watching my kids’ sporting events. Okay, maybe the sporting events bring a little stress upon me, but it all goes away after the game is over. 
<br><br>
Shopping is my top favorite interest. I asked a girlfriend to give me her opinion on what she thought my greatest interest was and she said it’s definitely shopping. Her tone made it sound like I shouldn’t even ask such a silly question! Well, I had no idea it was so noticeable to others, but since I am known to give her my hand-me-downs every time I indulge, it’s probably more prevalent to her than to anyone else who knows me well. I spend many lunch breaks and Saturday afternoons on the hunt for a cash-savings, clearance rack purchase. I will dig at any Ross, TJ Maxx or Marshall’s for the best, brand name deals. Of course, I’m not just thinking of myself when I actively take over the shoe or clothing department. I keep my kids, friends and friend’s kids in mind if the size and price are right!
